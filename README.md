# Natural language Processing for fun
This is a demonstration platform for showing how to use Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to build creative applications implemented through [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
It shows that Streamlit can be used to convert python data scripts into shareable web apps. It is pure python and does not require front-end experience.

## 2. Getting Started
This section shows you how to set up your local programming environment.
### 2.1 Set Up Programming Environment

#### 2.1.1 Install Python 3

Require python 3.9 or above. Please refer to [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for download and installation. 

#### 2.1.2 Install IDE (optional)

You may also install the IDE for development and testing your script. For example, you
may use [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Both of 
them support Windows, Mac and Linux. The Day One lecture uses Pycharm.

#### 2.1.2 Install Anaconda (optional)
Anaconda offers the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning 
on a single machine. Start working with thousands of open-source packages and libraries 
today. 

Please refer to [here](https://www.anaconda.com/#) for download and installation. 

#### 2.1.3 Install Required package
Please use the below commands to clone the repo and install required package.

**A.** You can download the repository, or clone the repository using the following code.
